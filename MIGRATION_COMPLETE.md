# ✅ Migration Complete: TeamOrchestrator → OrchestrationCoordinator

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
**System Version**: 2.0.0 (Phase-based orchestration)

---

## 📊 Summary

Successfully migrated from monolithic `TeamOrchestrator.ts` (1800+ lines) to modular phase-based orchestration system following **Claude Agent SDK best practices**.

### What Changed

| Component | Old System | New System |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Orchestration** | TeamOrchestrator.ts (monolithic) | OrchestrationCoordinator.ts + Phase files |
| **Developer Types** | senior-developer, junior-developer | developer (unified) |
| **Approval System** | Polling-based | Event-based (approvalEvents) |
| **Model** | Mixed (sonnet/haiku) | claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 (all agents) |
| **File Specifications** | Vague descriptions | EXACT file paths (Read/Modify/Create) |
| **Code Enforcement** | Weak | **ULTRA-STRONG** (Judge auto-rejects .md, TODO, stubs) |
| **SDK Compliance** | Partial | 100% compliant |

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **AgentDefinitions.ts** - All Agents with Haiku 4.5
- [x] All agents use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- [x] Tool restrictions per agent type
- [x] Structured JSON output requirements

### 2. **Developer Prompts** - ULTRA-REINFORCED
- [x] **FORBIDDEN**: ANY .md files (README.md, DOCS.md, etc.)
- [x] **FORBIDDEN**: TODO, FIXME, STUB comments
- [x] **FORBIDDEN**: Empty placeholder functions
- [x] **REQUIRED**: Use Edit() and Write() for CODE files only
- [x] **REQUIRED**: Complete, functional implementations

### 3. **Judge Prompts** - STRICT ENFORCEMENT
- [x] Auto-rejects if ANY .md file created
- [x] Auto-rejects if TODO/FIXME/STUB found
- [x] Auto-rejects if stub functions detected
- [x] Uses Grep() to find incomplete code
- [x] Provides specific, actionable feedback

### 4. **TechLeadPhase** - File Paths (Not Contents)
- [x] Specifies EXACT file paths only
- [x] `filesToRead`: paths developers should Read()
- [x] `filesToModify`: paths developers should Edit()
- [x] `filesToCreate`: paths developers should Write()
- [x] Developers fetch file contents from repository

### 5. **ApprovalPhase** - Event-Based System
- [x] Uses `approvalEvents` (no polling)
- [x] Integrates with existing frontend UI
- [x] Auto-approval support (skip phases if configured)
- [x] Approval history tracking
- [x] 24-hour timeout

### 6. **OrchestrationCoordinator** - SDK query() Implementation
- [x] Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk query()`
- [x] Single-mode (non-streaming) execution
- [x] Tool restrictions enforced
- [x] Working directory set to `cwd`
- [x] Token usage tracking

### 7. **Routes** - Using New Coordinator
- [x] `routes/tasks.ts` uses `OrchestrationCoordinator`
- [x] `approvalEvents` imported from `ApprovalEvents.ts`
- [x] Old `TeamOrchestrator` references removed

### 8. **ApprovalEvents.ts** - Extracted Event System
- [x] Standalone event emitter module
- [x] No dependency on TeamOrchestrator
- [x] Singleton pattern
- [x] Used by ApprovalPhase and routes

### 9. **TeamOrchestrator.ts** - DEPRECATED
- [x] Renamed to `TeamOrchestrator.ts.OLD` (backup)
- [x] No longer used in codebase
- [x] Can be deleted after successful testing

## 🚀 Phase Execution Flow

```
OrchestrationCoordinator.orchestrateTask()
  ↓
ProductManager (analyzes requirements)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase (waits for human approval via events)
ProjectManager (breaks into stories)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase
TechLead (creates branches + specifies EXACT file paths)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase
Developers (writes CODE using Edit/Write on specified paths)
  ↓
Judge (evaluates code, auto-rejects .md/TODO/stubs, max 3 retries)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase
QA (runs tests, build, lint)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase
Merge (creates PRs, detects conflicts)
  ↓ ApprovalPhase (final approval)
COMPLETED
```

## 🛡️ Code Quality Enforcement

### Developer Agent
```typescript
FORBIDDEN:
❌ Write("README.md", ...)  → Judge will REJECT
❌ Write("src/file.ts", "// TODO: implement")  → Judge will REJECT
❌ function stub() { /* placeholder */ }  → Judge will REJECT

REQUIRED:
✅ Write("src/AuthService.ts", "class AuthService { ... }")  → Judge will APPROVE
✅ Edit("src/routes/user.ts", "router.get(...)")  → Judge will APPROVE
```

### Judge Agent
```typescript
EVALUATION PROCESS:
1. Read() files that should have been modified
2. Grep("TODO|FIXME|STUB|PLACEHOLDER") → If found → REJECT
3. Grep("\.md") → If .md files found → REJECT
4. Verify functions have real implementations → If stubs → REJECT
5. Check requirements met → If incomplete → REJECT

AUTOMATIC REJECTION:
- ANY .md file → INSTANT FAIL
- ANY TODO comment → INSTANT FAIL
- ANY stub function → INSTANT FAIL
```

## 📊 SDK Compliance Checklist

- [x] **query() from SDK** - Using @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
- [x] **Model**: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 (all agents)
- [x] **Single-mode** - Non-streaming execution
- [x] **Tool restrictions** - Per agent type (via AgentDefinitions)
- [x] **Context compaction** - After 5 phases (prevents loops)
- [x] **Human feedback loop** - Approval gates at each phase
- [x] **Judge verification** - Code quality gate with retry (SDK pattern)
- [x] **Event-based** - No polling (approvalEvents)
- [x] **Error handling** - Graceful failures with rollback
- [x] **Cost tracking** - Token usage logged per agent

---

## 🧪 Testing

See **`ORCHESTRATION_TESTING.md`** for complete testing guide.

**Quick Test**:
```bash
# 1. Start backend
npm start

# 2. Create task via frontend
# 3. Send message: "Create a health check endpoint"
# 4. Click "Start Orchestration"
# 5. Approve each phase
# 6. Verify:
#    - Developers write CODE (not .md files)
#    - Judge rejects if TODO/stubs found
#    - PRs created successfully
```

---

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If critical issues found during testing:

```bash
# 1. Restore old orchestrator
mv src/services/TeamOrchestrator.ts.OLD src/services/TeamOrchestrator.ts

# 2. Update routes
# In src/routes/tasks.ts, change:
import { OrchestrationCoordinator } from '../services/orchestration/OrchestrationCoordinator';
# Back to:
import { TeamOrchestrator } from '../services/TeamOrchestrator';

# And change:
const orchestrationCoordinator = new OrchestrationCoordinator();
# Back to:
const teamOrchestrator = new TeamOrchestrator();

# 3. Restart server
npm start
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Testing** - Complete end-to-end test (see ORCHESTRATION_TESTING.md)
2. **Verify** - Ensure developers write CODE (not documentation)
3. **Monitor** - Check Judge properly rejects .md/TODO/stubs
4. **Multi-repo** - Test with frontend + backend simultaneously
5. **Delete Backup** - If all tests pass, delete `TeamOrchestrator.ts.OLD`

---

## 📞 Support

If issues arise:
1. Check console logs for detailed error messages
2. Review `ORCHESTRATION_TESTING.md` for debugging steps
3. Verify AgentDefinitions.ts prompts are correctly loaded
4. Check approvalEvents are being emitted/received
5. Ensure claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 model is available
