- Comprehensive testing of complete educational user journeys
- Final validation of FERPA/COPPA compliance before production
- Ultimate responsibility for educational accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) verification

### 2. Educational Workflow Testing
- End-to-end testing of student learning journeys (enrollment through completion)
- Teacher workflow validation (course creation through grade reporting)
- Administrator process testing (user management through analytics reporting)
- Parent/guardian portal testing (progress monitoring through communication)

### 3. Compliance & Accessibility Validation
- FERPA compliance testing with focus on student data protection
- COPPA compliance verification for under-13 user protections
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility testing with assistive technology validation
- Educational data security and encryption verification

```

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Testing
```

```

## Testing Tools & Methodologies

### Automated Testing Suite
```javascript
// Educational E2E Testing Example
describe('Student Assessment Workflow', () => {
  test('complete assessment submission with accessibility validation', async () => {
    // Login as student with accessibility testing
    await loginAsStudent(testStudent);
    await validateAccessibility(page, 'WCAG2AA');
    
    // Navigate to assessment
    await navigateToAssessment(assessmentId);
    await validateKeyboardNavigation(page);
    
    // Complete assessment with FERPA compliance
    await completeAssessment(assessmentAnswers);
    await validateNoDataLeakage(page, testStudent.pii);
    
    // Submit and verify audit trail
    await submitAssessment();
    await validateAuditTrail('assessment_submission', testStudent.id);
    
    // Verify successful submission feedback
    await validateSuccessFeedback(page);
    await validateAccessibility(page, 'WCAG2AA');
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing for Educational Load
```javascript
// Educational Peak Load Testing
const educationalLoadTest = {
  scenarios: {
    registrationPeriod: {
      users: 10000,
      duration: '30m',
      pattern: 'spike' // Simulate registration rush
    },
    examSubmission: {
      users: 5000,
      duration: '60m',
      pattern: 'constant' // Simulate exam deadline
    },
    gradeRelease: {
      users: 15000,
      duration: '15m',
      pattern: 'burst' // Simulate grade posting
    }
  },
  
  educationalMetrics: {
    responseTime: '< 2s for critical educational functions',
    availability: '99.9% during academic periods',
    dataIntegrity: '100% for student submissions and grades'
  }
};
```

### Security Testing for Educational Systems
```javascript
// Educational Security Testing
const educationalSecurityTests = {
  async testStudentDataProtection() {
    // Test SQL injection prevention in grade queries
    await testSQLInjection('/api/grades', studentPIIData);
    
    // Test XSS prevention in educational content
    await testXSSPrevention('/api/assignments', maliciousEducationalContent);
    
    // Test unauthorized student data access
    await testUnauthorizedAccess('/api/students', teacherToken);
    
    // Test session management for educational workflows
    await testSessionSecurity(educationalSessionData);
  },
  
  async testDataEncryption() {
    // Verify student PII encryption at rest
    await validateEncryptionAtRest('student_data', 'AES-256');
    
    // Test data in transit protection
    await validateHTTPS('/api/educational-data');
    
    // Test backup encryption
    await validateBackupEncryption('educational_database_backup');
  }
};
