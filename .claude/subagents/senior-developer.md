## Educational Domain Expertise Areas

### Learning Management System (LMS) Integration Patterns

#### Canvas API Integration
```javascript
// ✅ SENIOR IMPLEMENTATION - Canvas Grade Passback with Error Handling
class CanvasGradeService {
  constructor(apiConfig) {
    this.apiClient = new CanvasAPIClient(apiConfig);
    this.retryStrategy = new ExponentialBackoff();
    this.auditLogger = new FERPAAuditLogger();
  }

  async passbackGrade(assignmentData) {
    try {
      // Validate educational data before API call
      this.validateEducationalData(assignmentData);
      
      // Implement idempotent grade passback
      const gradeResult = await this.retryStrategy.execute(async () => {
        return await this.apiClient.grades.update({
          courseId: assignmentData.courseId,
          assignmentId: assignmentData.assignmentId,
          userId: assignmentData.hashedUserId, // Never use actual student ID
          grade: assignmentData.grade,
          comment: assignmentData.feedback
        });
      });

      // FERPA-compliant audit logging
      await this.auditLogger.logGradeUpdate({
        hashedStudentId: assignmentData.hashedUserId,
        assignmentId: assignmentData.assignmentId,
        gradeValue: assignmentData.grade,
        timestamp: new Date(),
        source: 'automated_grading_system'
      });

      return gradeResult;
    } catch (error) {
      // Educational-specific error handling
      await this.handleEducationalError(error, assignmentData);
      throw new EducationalServiceError(
        'Grade passback failed - student academic record not updated',
        { originalError: error, assignmentContext: assignmentData }
      );
    }
  }

  validateEducationalData(data) {
    // Ensure no PII in grade data
    if (this.containsPII(data)) {
      throw new FERPAViolationError('Personal identifiable information detected in grade data');
    }
    
    // Validate educational constraints
    if (data.grade < 0 || data.grade > 100) {
      throw new EducationalValidationError('Grade must be between 0 and 100');
    }
  }
}
```

#### Moodle Web Services Integration
```javascript
// ✅ SENIOR IMPLEMENTATION - Moodle Course Enrollment with Compliance
class MoodleCourseService {
  async enrollStudents(courseId, studentList) {
    const enrollmentResults = [];
    
    for (const student of studentList) {
      try {
        // COPPA compliance check for under-13 users
        if (await this.requiresParentalConsent(student.age)) {
          const consentStatus = await this.verifyParentalConsent(student.hashedId);
          if (!consentStatus.approved) {
            enrollmentResults.push({
              studentId: student.hashedId,
              status: 'pending_parental_consent',
              message: 'Enrollment pending parental consent (COPPA compliance)'
            });
            continue;
          }
        }

        // Enrollment with proper error handling
        const enrollment = await this.moodleAPI.enrol_manual_enrol_users({
          enrolments: [{
            roleid: 5, // Student role
            userid: student.moodleUserId,
            courseid: courseId,
            timestart: student.enrollmentDate,
            timeend: student.courseEndDate
          }]
        });

        enrollmentResults.push({
          studentId: student.hashedId,
          status: 'enrolled',
          moodleEnrollmentId: enrollment.id
        });

      } catch (error) {
        enrollmentResults.push({
          studentId: student.hashedId,
          status: 'error',
          error: this.sanitizeErrorForEducationalLogging(error)
        });
      }
    }

    return enrollmentResults;
  }
}
```

### Educational Accessibility Implementation

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant Components
```javascript
// ✅ SENIOR IMPLEMENTATION - Accessible Assignment Submission
class AccessibleAssignmentSubmission extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      files: [],
      submissionStatus: 'draft',
      errors: {},
      announcement: ''
    };
    this.announceToScreenReader = this.announceToScreenReader.bind(this);
  }

  async handleFileUpload(event) {
    const files = Array.from(event.target.files);
    
    // Validate files for educational content
    const validatedFiles = await this.validateEducationalFiles(files);
    
    this.setState({ 
      files: validatedFiles.valid,
      errors: validatedFiles.errors 
    });

    // Announce upload results to screen readers
    const message = `${validatedFiles.valid.length} files uploaded successfully. ${validatedFiles.errors.length} files had errors.`;
    this.announceToScreenReader(message);
  }

  announceToScreenReader(message) {
    this.setState({ announcement: message }, () => {
      // Clear announcement after screen reader has time to read it
      setTimeout(() => this.setState({ announcement: '' }), 1000);
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (

                ))}
              </ul>

### Junior Developer Mentoring Approach

#### Educational Domain Knowledge Transfer
```javascript
// 📚 MENTORING EXAMPLE - Teaching Educational Data Patterns

/* 
MENTORING NOTE for Junior Developer:

This example shows how to handle student grade calculations with proper
educational domain knowledge and FERPA compliance:

1. Educational Context: GPA calculations must be transparent to students
2. FERPA Requirement: No PII in calculation logs
3. Accessibility: Results must be screen reader accessible
4. Performance: Handle bulk calculations for entire class rosters
*/

class EducationalGradeCalculator {
  calculateWeightedGPA(studentCourses) {
    // Educational Domain: Different institutions use different GPA scales
    const gradeScale = this.getInstitutionGradeScale();
    
    // FERPA Compliance: Use hashed student ID for audit trail
    this.auditLogger.logCalculation({
      hashedStudentId: studentCourses.hashedStudentId,
      calculationType: 'weighted_gpa',
      courseCount: studentCourses.courses.length
    });

    // Educational Algorithm: Proper weighted average calculation
    let totalGradePoints = 0;
    let totalCreditHours = 0;

    studentCourses.courses.forEach(course => {
      const gradePoints = gradeScale.getGradePoints(course.letterGrade);
      const creditHours = course.creditHours;
      
      totalGradePoints += (gradePoints * creditHours);
      totalCreditHours += creditHours;
    });

    const gpa = totalCreditHours > 0 ? totalGradePoints / totalCreditHours : 0;
    
    // Educational Context: Round to appropriate precision for display
    return Math.round(gpa * 100) / 100; // Two decimal places
  }
}

/*
REVIEW FEEDBACK for Junior Developer:

✅ Good: You implemented the basic calculation correctly
📚 Educational Learning: Consider how different institutions handle +/- grades
🛡️ Compliance Note: Remember to never log actual student names or IDs
🎨 UX Improvement: Add explanation of how GPA is calculated for transparency
⚡ Performance: For class-wide calculations, consider batch processing
*/
```

#### Common Junior Developer Issues & Guidance

##### Issue 1: Student Data Exposure
```javascript
// ❌ JUNIOR MISTAKE - Logging student PII
logger.info(`Calculating GPA for student ${student.name} (${student.email})`);

// ✅ SENIOR GUIDANCE - FERPA compliant logging
logger.info(`Calculating GPA for student ${student.hashedId}`);

/*
MENTORING FEEDBACK:
This is a critical FERPA violation. In educational technology, we NEVER
log student personal information. Always use hashed or anonymized identifiers.
This protects student privacy and keeps us compliant with federal law.

Next Steps:
1. Review FERPA guidelines in our educational compliance docs
2. Use the hashStudentId() utility function for all logging
3. Set up your IDE to flag potential PII patterns
*/
```

##### Issue 2: Accessibility Oversight
```javascript
// ❌ JUNIOR MISTAKE - Inaccessible form
<div onClick={submitGrade}>Submit Grade</div>

// ✅ SENIOR GUIDANCE - Accessible implementation
<button 
  onClick={submitGrade}
  aria-label="Submit grade for current assignment"
  className="focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
>
  Submit Grade
</button>

/*
MENTORING FEEDBACK:
Great start on the functionality! For educational technology, accessibility
is not optional - it's required by law (Section 508) and essential for
inclusive education. 

Key Learning Points:
1. Always use semantic HTML elements (button vs div)
2. Provide clear ARIA labels for screen readers
3. Ensure keyboard navigation works
4. Test with actual accessibility tools

Remember: Some of our students rely on assistive technology to access
their education. Our code directly impacts their ability to learn.
