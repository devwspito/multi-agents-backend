/**
 * BranchCleanupService - Automatic branch cleanup after epic merge
 *
 * Problem: After orchestration completes, GitHub has dozens of story branches
 * that are no longer needed (epic/*, story/*). This creates clutter and confusion.
 *
 * Solution: Track epic ‚Üí story branch relationships, then clean up systematically:
 * 1. When epic PR is merged ‚Üí delete all story branches for that epic
 * 2. After merge confirmation ‚Üí delete the epic branch itself
 * 3. Keep only main branch clean
