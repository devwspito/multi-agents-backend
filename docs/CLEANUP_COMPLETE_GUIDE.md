1. **🔧 Manual Cleanup** - On-demand via API
2. **🤖 Automatic Cleanup** - GitHub webhook triggers on PR merge
3. **⏰ Scheduled Cleanup** - Daily job cleans old branches

---

## Problem Statement

### Before Cleanup System

```
GitHub Branches (Total: 47 branches)
├── main
├── epic/c0d33d27-epic-webhook-objectid-fix-1761242026720-9nmggb
├── story/c0d33d27-epic-webhook-objectid-fix-story-2-1761242265667-15adh4
├── epic/c0d33d27-epic-webhook-observability-1761242162424-b10ow8
├── story/c0d33d27-epic-webhook-observability-story-4-1761243483385-lw8x79

├── story/c0d33d27-epic-webhook-event-expansion-story-3-1761243311262-a5cd6o
... 40+ more branches
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ Can't tell which story belongs to which epic
- ❌ No idea which branches are safe to delete
- ❌ Manual cleanup takes hours
- ❌ Fear of deleting wrong branch

### After Cleanup System

```
GitHub Branches (Total: 1 branch)
└── main
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Automatic tracking of epic → story relationships
- ✅ One-click cleanup after PR merge
- ✅ Automatic cleanup via webhook
- ✅ Scheduled daily cleanup
- ✅ Clean, organized repository

---

## Features

### ✨ Feature 1: Manual Cleanup (API)

**What:** Call API endpoint to clean up branches on demand

**When to use:** After manually merging PRs in GitHub

**Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/cleanup/preview/:taskId` - Preview before deletion
- `POST /api/cleanup/task/:taskId` - Clean all branches
- `POST /api/cleanup/epic/:taskId/:epicId` - Clean single epic

**Example:**
```bash
# Preview
curl http://localhost:5001/api/cleanup/preview/67890abc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"

# Clean up
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/cleanup/task/67890abc \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

---

### ✨ Feature 2: Automatic Cleanup (GitHub Webhook)

**What:** Automatically clean up branches when epic PR is merged

**When triggered:** GitHub sends webhook when PR merged

**Flow:**
1. You merge epic PR in GitHub UI
2. GitHub sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/github`
3. System detects epic branch merged
4. Finds all story branches for that epic
5. Deletes story branches + epic branch automatically

**Setup required:** Configure GitHub webhook (see below)

**Example webhook payload:**
```json
{
  "action": "closed",
  "pull_request": {
    "number": 42,
    "title": "Epic: Webhook Improvements",
    "head": { "ref": "epic/webhook-improvements" },
    "merged": true
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Cleanup triggered successfully",
  "taskId": "67890abc",
  "epicId": "epic-1",
  "branchName": "epic/webhook-improvements",
  "storyBranchesCount": 4
}
```

---

### ✨ Feature 3: Scheduled Cleanup (Cron)

**What:** Daily job cleans up old merged branches

**When:** Runs automatically at 2:00 AM every day

**What it cleans:**
- Completed tasks from last 30 days
- All epic and story branches for those tasks

**Control:**
```bash
# Check status
GET /api/cleanup/scheduled/status

# Run manually (for testing)
POST /api/cleanup/scheduled/run

# Response
{
  "isRunning": false,
  "schedulerActive": true,
  "nextRun": "Daily at 2:00 AM",
  "info": "Scheduled cleanup runs daily at 2:00 AM to clean up old branches"
}
```

**Logs:**
```

## Usage

### Scenario 1: Manual Cleanup After PR Merge

**Step 1:** Complete orchestration
```bash
POST /api/tasks/67890abc/start
```

**Step 2:** QA creates epic PRs in GitHub

**Step 3:** Review and merge PRs manually in GitHub UI

**Step 4:** Preview cleanup
```bash
GET /api/cleanup/preview/67890abc
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Preview: 12 branches would be deleted across 3 epic(s)",
  "epics": [
    {
      "epicBranch": "epic/webhook-improvements",
      "branchesToDelete": [
        "epic/webhook-improvements",
        "story/webhook-story-1",
        "story/webhook-story-2",
        "story/webhook-story-3"
      ],
      "totalBranchCount": 4
    }
  ],
  "totalBranches": 12
}
```

**Step 5:** Clean up
```bash
POST /api/cleanup/task/67890abc
```

**Result:** 12 branches deleted ✅

---

### Scenario 2: Automatic Cleanup via Webhook

**Step 1:** Configure GitHub webhook (one-time setup)

Go to: `https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/settings/hooks`

Add webhook:
- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github`
- Content type: `application/json`
- Secret: Same as `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env`
- Events: `Pull requests`

**Step 2:** Merge epic PR in GitHub UI

Click "Merge pull request" button

**Step 3:** Webhook triggers automatically

```
🎯 GitHub Webhook: PR Merged
Repository: your-org/your-repo
PR #42: Epic: Webhook Improvements
Branch: epic/webhook-improvements

✅ Found task: 67890abc
   Task title: Implement webhook system
   Task status: completed

🧹 Auto-cleanup triggered for epic: epic/webhook-improvements
   Story branches to delete: 3

✅ Auto-cleanup complete: 4 branches deleted
```

**Result:** Branches deleted automatically, no manual action needed! 🎉

---

### Scenario 3: Scheduled Cleanup

**No action required!** The system automatically:

1. Runs daily at 2:00 AM
2. Finds completed tasks from last 30 days
3. Cleans up all branches for those tasks
4. Logs results

**Check status:**
```bash
GET /api/cleanup/scheduled/status

{
  "isRunning": false,
  "schedulerActive": true,
  "nextRun": "Daily at 2:00 AM"
}
```

**Manual trigger (for testing):**
```bash
POST /api/cleanup/scheduled/run

{
  "message": "Scheduled cleanup started in background",
  "info": "Check server logs for progress"
}
```

## GitHub Webhook Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Server URL

Your webhook URL:
```
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github
```

For development (using ngrok):
```bash
ngrok http 5001

# Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
# Webhook URL: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/github
```

### Step 2: Create Webhook Secret

Generate a random secret:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32

# Example output: 8f4a9b2c3d1e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0
```

Add to `.env`:
```bash
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=8f4a9b2c3d1e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0
```

### Step 3: Configure in GitHub

1. Go to your repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
3. Fill in:
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/github`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Paste the secret from Step 2
   - **Events**: Select "Let me select individual events" → Check **Pull requests**
   - **Active**: ✅ Checked
4. Click **Add webhook**

### Step 4: Test Webhook

Merge a test PR and check server logs:

```
🎯 GitHub Webhook: PR Merged
Repository: your-org/your-repo
PR #42: Test PR
Branch: epic/test-branch

✅ Found task: 67890abc
🧹 Auto-cleanup triggered
✅ Auto-cleanup complete: 4 branches deleted
```

If you see this, webhook is working! 🎉

---

## Scheduled Cleanup

### How It Works

**Cron Schedule:** `0 2 * * *` (Every day at 2:00 AM)

**Process:**
1. Finds completed tasks from last 30 days
2. Builds branch mappings for each task
3. Deletes epic + story branches
4. Logs results

**Example Log:**
```
🧹 SCHEDULED CLEANUP STARTED
Time: 2025-01-24T02:00:00.000Z

🔍 Finding completed tasks...
📋 Found 15 completed task(s) to check

🧹 Processing task: 67890abc
   ✅ Deleted 4 branch(es)

🧹 Processing task: 67890def
   ✅ Deleted 6 branch(es)

✅ SCHEDULED CLEANUP COMPLETE
   Tasks processed: 15
   Branches deleted: 47
   Errors: 0
```

### Manual Trigger

For testing or emergency cleanup:

```bash
POST /api/cleanup/scheduled/run

# Server logs will show:
🧹 Manual cleanup triggered
🔍 Finding completed tasks...
✅ Manual cleanup complete: 47 branches deleted
```

### Check Status

```bash
GET /api/cleanup/scheduled/status

{
  "isRunning": false,
  "schedulerActive": true,
  "nextRun": "Daily at 2:00 AM"
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "No branch mappings found"

**Cause:** Task orchestration data is missing

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check task data
GET /api/tasks/:taskId

# Verify teamOrchestration exists
task.orchestration.teamOrchestration.teams[]
```

---

### Error: "Failed to delete branch X"

**Possible causes:**
1. Branch already deleted
2. GitHub token lacks permissions
3. Branch is protected

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check GitHub permissions
# Ensure user has "delete_ref" permission

# Check if branch exists
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/branches/branch-name
```

---

### Error: "Invalid GitHub webhook signature"

**Cause:** Webhook secret mismatch

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct secret
2. Verify GitHub webhook settings
3. Restart server after changing `.env`

---

### Webhook Not Triggering

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check GitHub webhook deliveries:**
   - Go to GitHub → Settings → Webhooks
   - Click on your webhook
   - Check "Recent Deliveries"
   - Look for green ✅ (success) or red ❌ (failure)

2. **Check server logs:**
   ```bash
   # Should see:
   🎯 GitHub Webhook: PR Merged
   ```

3. **Test webhook endpoint:**
   ```bash
   GET /api/webhooks/github/test

   {
     "message": "GitHub webhook endpoint is ready",
     "webhookSecretConfigured": true
   }
   ```

---

### Scheduled Cleanup Not Running

**Debug:**

```bash
# Check status
GET /api/cleanup/scheduled/status

# Response should show:
{
  "schedulerActive": true,  # ✅ Should be true
  "nextRun": "Daily at 2:00 AM"
}

# If false, check server logs for startup errors
```

---
